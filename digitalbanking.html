                10 Benefits of digital banking in india
            </h1>
            <div style="padding: 20px;">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">When demonetisation happened, we saw the several advantages of digital
                    banking.
                    Standing in those ATM lines for hours just suddenly felt redundant. Then we found ourselves in the
                    midst
                    of a pandemic, where we kept our distance from other people. It’s no wonder that digital banking in
                    India has grown in popularity in recent times. The need to go cash-free and be able to bank remotely
                    is
                    higher than ever before. Just like everything else we do, we also prefer our banking to be remote,
                    from
                    a smartphone or on our laptops-
                    <br>
                    Since we’re now living in the digital era, banking and other financial services have also taken
                    leaps in
                    these times. While there are a tonne of differences between traditional and digital banking, let's
                    have
                    a look at the advantages of new age banking. Here are the top 10 most prominent advantages of
                    digital
                    banking in India.

        <h1 align="center">Ten advantages of digital banking in India</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>1. Ease of signing up</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, banks would require you to visit one of their branches, wait in line, fill out some
                paperwork, print out copies of your identity and address proofs, and then finally, you would be able to
                sign up for a bank account. Digital banking has simplified this process. Now, signing up can just take a
                couple of minutes and can be done from any location. All you have to do is enter your details, upload
                scanned copies of ID and address proof, and verify your account. Signing up for a bank account has never
                been this easy. Here's a step -by-step guide on how you can make an online bank account.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>2. The convenience of usage </h2>
            <p>People with traditional bank accounts and no online banking presence have to go to the bank's physical
                location in order to process their requests. This process can be time-consuming and tiring. Compared to
                this, digital banking is way more convenient. Their features can be accessed remotely from anywhere in
                the world at the click of a button. Digital banking is also way faster at processing requests.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>3. Higher interest rates/ lower fees </h2>
            <p>Since a lot of processes are automated with the help of digital banking, a lot of these services can
                result in reducing certain banking fees like transaction fees and maintenance fees. This can result in
                customers getting higher interest rates for their accounts. However, not all digital banks offer higher
                interest rates and slashed fees.

                Fi offers zero balance savings account with an interest rate of 2.65%</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>4. Going cash-free</h2>
            <p>If demonetisation and the Covid- 19 pandemic are any indications, going cash-free is more in demand than
                ever before. Thankfully, digital banking solves this problem. Several digital banking features like
                UPIs, mobile wallets, and internet banking solutions allow users to make payments cash-free. This form
                of banking may also save a substantial amount of paper, making it better for the environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>5. 24 x 7 banking </h2>
            <p>Traditional banks only operate for a certain period of time. These banks have allotted different time
                slots to visit the bank based on the day. They are also closed during bank holidays. Owing to these
                short visiting time intervals, account holders might find it difficult to take time out of their
                schedule to visit these banks. Digital banking has all but done away with this problem entirely.
                Automated banking features through apps mean they can be accessed 24 x 7.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>6. Personalised Features </h2>
            <p>Digital banking offers you a more personalised banking experience. Unlike typical banks' cookie-cutter
                features, digital banking may offer features like bill payment reminders, personalised budgets, money
                management, big purchase savings, and so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>‍7. Easier bill payments </h2>
            <p>‍Before the digital era, you would have to pay your utility bills manually. With digital banking, bill
                payments are easier than ever before. You can choose to set reminders for your bill payments and clear
                them in just a few seconds through your mobile banking app. Alternatively, you could also automate these
                bill payments through the app, so money is automatically deducted and sent towards clearing these bills.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>‍8. Rewards </h2>
            <p>Digital banking also offers rewards rewards for using their services. These could be one-time rewards or
                in the form of a point system wherein you can redeem rewards of your choice through points. These
                rewards include things like points on transactions, discount codes for E-Commerce websites, and others.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>9. Reduced black money circulation</h2>
            <p>As the Indian banking system moves more towards digital banking, it could positively affect the economy
                as it tends to be difficult to use black money digitally. Digital banking may be a positive step toward
                curbing the use of black and counterfeit money.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>10. Banking in remote locations </h2>
            <p>Perhaps one of the most crucial advantages of digital banking in India is it allows people in remote
                locations to access banking services. While these people might not have access to a bank in their
                locality, they can start a bank account and enjoy its privileges as long as they have a mobile phone.
                Digital banking has been a positive step towards inclusivity when it comes to the underbanked.</p>
