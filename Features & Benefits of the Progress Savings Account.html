            <div style="width: 30%; padding: 20px;">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">For most of us, a Savings Account is the first formal relationship with a
                    bank. Whether you want to apply for a personal loan or credit card or whether you want to invest in
                    mutual funds or buy an insurance plan, you need a savings bank account for carrying out the
                    transactions. While transacting may be the primary function of a savings account, it also has
                    several other benefits. Let us see what these are:

        <h1 align="center">9 Benefits of Havings a Savings Account</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>1.Introduction to real-world finance:</h2>
            <p> A savings account is often the first interaction an individual has with the financial and banking
                system. It is a multipurpose account. First, it is a safe place to park your funds. Second, it helps you
                organise your finances. There are several types of savings accounts. They vary based on the minimum
                balance required, features such as the number of free cash transactions, cheque book facilities,
                discounts and offers among other things.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>2. Earns money for you: </h2>
            <p>Most savings accounts offer interest rates of around 3%. This means your money is making money for you
                even when you are sleeping. Some savings accounts offer as much as 6% interest, provided you maintain a
                higher balance in the account. Besides, interest earned on a savings account is exempt from income tax
                up to a maximum of Rs 10,000 in a year.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>3. Debit Cards: </h2>
            <p>Most savings account come with a debit card which you can use for shopping, whether online or offline.
                This means you won’t need to carry cash with you at all times. Banks also offer discounts on select
                brands and cashback offers on debit card purchases, which you will not get if you pay in cash.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>4.High liquidity:</h2>
            <p> There is no lock-in period for the money in your savings account. You can withdraw your money from a
                savings account at any time. You do it via an ATM or by cheque at a bank branch.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>5. Digital services: </h2>
            <p> In addition to debit card discounts and cashback, banks also offer services such as net banking,
                chequebook and passbook with a savings account. Some accounts also offer insurance policies depending on
                the customer segment.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>6. Value-added services: </h2>
            <p>Digital banking offers you a more personalised banking experience. Unlike typical banks' cookie-cutter
                features, digital banking may offer features like bill payment reminders, personalised budgets, money
                management, big purchase savings, and so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>‍7. Money is safe: </h2>
            <p>There is a chance that your cash might get lost or stolen if you carry it with you. However, a savings
                account is insured for up to Rs 5 lakh by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
                (DICGC)..
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>‍8. A place to receive funds: </h2>
            <p> Apart from making payments, a savings account is a great option to receive funds from third parties.
                There are no limits on the number of cheques deposited or issued or the number of payments made to and
                from a savings account. This ensures that you have a hassle-free experience on owning as well as
                operating a savings account.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>9. Emergency fund: </h2>
            <p> A savings account is an ideal place for you to store your emergency fund. It inculcates the habit of
                saving. These funds serve as a backup in case you require cash for unforeseen expenses like medical
                expenses. You'd want your emergency fund to be in an account with immediate access so that there are no
                penalties and you can get your money out whenever you require it.
