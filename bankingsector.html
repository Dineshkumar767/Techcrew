      In 1969 surgeons implanted the first artificial heart, Dorothy Hodgkin determined the structure of insulin,
      the beginning of Bluetooth transmissions was born, and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. It’s been 50
      years since then — 50 years of technological advancements and cultural development. And the financial
      industry is no different. There have been a lot of advancements in the banking sector in the last 50 years
      or so, thanks to technology. Let’s take a look back through a brief history of banking technology to see just
      how far we’ve come.

    <p>
      The first most notable technological
      advancement in the financial industry was the
      advent of the credit card in 1950. “Diners Club
      introduced the first universal credit card, a
      portable payment solution that could be used at
      numerous member establishments.” <br><br><br>
      The introduction of the credit card fundamentally
      changed how consumers thought about their
      finances. They no longer had to carry or spend cash
      for every purchase. They now had the freedom to
      borrow against a line of credit that they could pay
      off at a future date. In general, credit cards allow
      consumers to make bigger purchases, without
      having to dip too deep into their savings.

      Fastforward,a little over a decade later to the 1960s, when the world was introduced
      to the first ATM. “A Scottish inventor named John
      Shepherd-Barron [thought] if vending machines
      could dispense chocolate bars, why couldn’t
      they dispense cash?”2
      Barclays Bank fell in love
      with the idea and the first ATM was created. With
      the invention of the ATM, customers were no
      longer constrained by bank hours and locations
      when they wanted to access their money. <br><br>
      The use of computers in banking was also
      introduced in the 1960s when the then-Bank of New
      South Wales announced it would purchase its first ever computer for the sum of £1 million. That’s about
      $26 million in today’s dollars.<br><br>
      <b>The use of computers sparked
        the first digital [banking]
        revolution.</b><br><br>
      The computer centrali[zed] the bank’s trading
      accounts by replacing the machine accounting
      operations used in each individual branch.” The
      hope was that a centralized place for accounts would
      streamline processes and allow financial institutions
      to place a stronger focus on customer service.
      The use of computers sparked the first digital
      revolution. “Banks started to invest heavily
      in computer technology to automate manual
      processing. By the 1970s, the first electronic
      payment systems for both international and domestic
      transactions were developed. The international
      SWIFT payment network was established in 1973 and
      domestic payment systems were developed around
      the world by banks working with governments.”

      In the 1980s, with digital technology well
      underway, the “term ‘online’ which referred
      to the use of a terminal, keyboard and TV to
      access the banking system using a phone line”
      gained popularity. With online banking came
      the benefits of lower transaction costs, easier
      integration of services, and more targeted
      marketing capabilities. <br><br>
      As online banking gained momentum, the
      first commercially available computer tablet,
      manufactured by Samsung in 1989, brought a new
      wave of convenience in retail banking. For the first
      time bank employees were allowed to “move within
      and even beyond the branch. Instead of waiting in
      line for the teller to become available, the teller might
      come to the door, greet a customer, sit on the couch
      with them and serve their needs from a mobile tablet
      as opposed to a tethered device.<br><br>
      Late in the 1990s, consumers were introduced to paypal,
      a P2P money service, enabling wireless transfers. The
      creation of PayPal spawned a myriad of like businesses format
      Venmo and Popmoney to
      Zelle.These services made it more convenient for people to pay for
      services wirelessly.

      The early 2000s, with the advent of wireless
      technology and the wide adoption of
      smartphones, brought the next major shift in
      the financial industry—mobile banking. Mobile
      banking made it possible for people to manage
      their financial lives from virtually anywhere
      and at any time. Now people could pay bills,
      check balances, transfer funds, or add new
      accounts all from their mobile devices. For the
      first time, the branch experience started to
      become secondary, as people flocked to the
      convenience and easy of their mobile devices. <br>
      In 2004, as mobile banking continued to grow in
      popularity, “the Check Clearing for the 21st Century
      Act” 3 was passed. The Act made it so “a check
      recipient could make a digital copy of a check and
      then process that check electronically.” The move to
      remote check deposit capture reduced the waiting
      period for check processing, adding convenience
      and making it possible for people to pay for bills and
      purchases faster than ever before. <br>
      About seven years later in 2011, Google introduced
      Google Wallet, a mobile payment technology meant
      to rival credit cards. For the first time people could
      use their phones directly for purchases. This opened
      up a whole new level of freedom, taking technology
      in the financial industry to a whole new level. Similar
      to Google Wallet, in 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay.<br>
      Heading the charge in 2015, “Bank of America...
      introduced fingerprint authentication and Touch ID,”

      making it easier and safer for people to log into
      their mobile banking apps. In the same year, the EMV
      chip technology became a standard among card
      issuers. The “EMV chips make cards far more secure
      because the information transmitted is encrypted
      and tokenized.”
      And it adds more security, which is
      “critical as payments become more integrated.”

      Today we’re seeing another major shift in the
      financial industry, largely brought about by
      consumers’ expectations for convenience,
      relevance, and ease. As technology continues
      to advance in the banking industry, it’s
      fundamentally changing the banking model.
      Consumers expect hyper-personalized and
      relevant communication from all of their online
      and offline interactions. And they don’t want
      to initiate the conversation. They want their
      financial institutions to keep them in the know
      about their finances and notify them if something
      needs their attention. In essence, they’re looking
      for a self-guided financial wellness solution.<br>
      But what exactly does self-guided financial wellness
      mean? In short, it means proactive financial advice
      at the right moment and time—helping people stay
      on top of all of their financial matters in real-time.
      People no longer simply want to trust their financial
      institution with their money. They want to trust that
      their financial institution understands them and has
      their best interest in mind when it comes to financial
      matters.
      <br>
      Luckily, financial institutions are well positioned to
      take advantage of everything technology has to
      offer. It’s now easier than ever before for financial
      institutions to access and act on their wealth of data
      to help customers make well-informed financial
      decisions. Whether it’s mobile apps enabling
      budgeting, notifications encouraging better spending
      habits, or ads informing customers on where to go
      for a better mortgage loan—there’s a lot that financial
      institutions can do to help their customers.
      <br><br>
      <b style="background-color: aqua;">People no longer simply want to trust
        their financial institution with their
        money. They want to trust that their
        financial institution understands them
        and has their best interest in mind
        when it comes to financial matters.
      </b>
    </p>
  </div><br>
  <p>
    And the best part is that financial institutions can do
    all this without having to fundamentally change their
    customers’ behavior towards finances. At MX, we’re
    ushering a new age of personal financial wellness
    with tools that do all the heavy lifting — from
    proactive notifications to guided financial advice, so
    everyone has access to the financial information
    they need to lead happier and healthier financial
    lives.</p>
