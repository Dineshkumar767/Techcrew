                What is the Difference between ATM Card and Debit Card

            </h1>
            <div style="width: 48%; padding: 20px;">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">Often, we tend to mistake an ATM card and Debit Card to be the same. This
                    is mainly because ATM and Debit Cards are quite similar in terms of their functions and use.
                    However, what we must know is that they are two different cards. An ATM card is a PIN-based card,
                    used to transact in ATMs only. While a Debit Card, on the other hand, is a much more
                    multi-functional card. They are accepted for transacting at a lot of places like stores,
                    restaurants, online in addition to ATM.<br>
                    Even though most banks these days issue you an ATM cum Debit Card, there are a few differentiating
                    factors between them.
                    <br>
                    Financial institutions, today, as per the usage the requirements of the customers, provide a
                    plethora of options in terms of financial tools like debit or credit cards. However, to use these
                    facilities in a judicious and efficient manner, it is necessary to understand the features of and
                    differences between ATM cards, debit and credit cards.

        <h1 align="center"><span> ' </span>Difference between ATM Card and Debit Card<span> ' </span></h1>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>What is ATM CARD ?</h2>
            <p>These are primarily issued by a financial institution (incl. banks). An ATM card, as the name suggests,
                can be used at an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw money from an account linked to the card.
                Earlier, ATM cards could be used only for “on-us” transactions. But, with the development of
                interconnected ATM networks, these cards can be used over a wider network of ATMs.</p>
            <h2>What is CREDIT CARD?</h2>
            <p>Credit cards allow you to borrow money for your transactions, to be repaid later. The money is borrowed
                from a respective credit card provider and must be repaid within a specified period. Interest is charged
                on the outstanding amount after the billing date. All the credit cards are linked to networks like VISA,
                MasterCard, Maestro, etc.</p>
            <h2>What is DEBIT CARD?</h2>
            <p>Just like ATM cards, are linked to specific saving or checking accounts. These cards can be used to make
                payments from the existing funds of your linked account. Like a credit card, they allow you to make a
                purchase at any POS or online outlets and have the added security of a PIN. Debit cards are also linked
                to networks like VISA, MasterCard, Maestro, RuPay, etc.</p>
            <h2>ATM CARDS VS. CREDIT CARDS OR DEBIT CARDS</h2>
            <p>An ATM card allows a customer only to withdraw money from an ATM, whereas a credit or debit card provides
                you with the facility of online payments and POS transactions. A debit or credit card holder can
                directly shop through his card eliminating the need to carry cash around.</p>
            <h2>DEBIT CARDS VS. CREDIT CARDS</h2>
            <p>The advantage of a credit card is that you can make urgent purchases or emergency payments on credit and
                repay the money later. Debit cards, on the other hand, use money already present in the linked account
                which helps you to manage your finances better and spend within your income limits.<br>
                With the advent of inter-connected ATM network and technological advancement of the banking sector,
                Indian banks have started issuing single multi-purpose cards like, "ATM-cum-debit cards" and
                "Debit-Credit cards." The ATM-cum-debit cards have become prevalent and can be used at ATMs to withdraw
                money and for POS and online transactions.<br>As they are linked to a bank account, the money gets
                debited from your existing funds. Debit-credit cards provide the dual facility of debiting the funds
                from your linked account and a certain overdraft facility for emergencies
            </p>
            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Debit and credit cards allow cardholders to withdraw cash and make purchases.</li>
                <li>Credit cards are debt instruments but debit cards are not.</li>
                <li>Debit card users can only spend the money available in their bank account unless they have overdraft
                    protection.</li>
                <li>A credit card is linked to a line of credit offered by the company that issues the card.</li>
                <li>Credit cards help build credit history while debit cards don't.</li>
            </ul>
