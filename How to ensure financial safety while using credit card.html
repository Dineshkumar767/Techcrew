                How to ensure financial safety while using credit card?
            </h1>
            <div style="width: 30%; padding: 20px;">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">Mrs. Kumar is an avid shopper. She uses her credit card to make
                    transactions regularly on ecommerce websites and also has her credit card information saved on most
                    of her favorite ecommerce stores. This enables her to pay for her purchases conveniently and
                    securely. However, in the wake of an increasing number of financial frauds, she is now worried about
                    how secure all these transactions really are. She wonders if there is any risk of financial fraud
                    and what all she can do to avoid becoming a victim of financial fraud.
                    <br>

                    This has become quite a real problem where online transactions have increased drastically. It
                    becomes all the more important to handle these transactions and our credit information in a way that
                    you don’t become a target of cyber-attacks..

        <h1 align="center">Here are a few tips that one should always follow to ensure financial safety whenever using a
            credit card.</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Use your credit card only on websites you trust</h2>
            <p>Today, there are many ecommerce websites out there selling all kinds of stuff. However, not all of them
                are credible. You should always make transactions using your credit card on credible and trustworthy
                websites only.
                <br>
                Don’t go on submitting your credit card information at random websites that may very well be a front for
                a cyber-attack.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Avoid shopping on public WiFi </h2>
            <p>Making transactions on any network that is public is never a safe option. This is because hacking a
                personal device connected to a public network is always easier as the connection is not secure. So,
                always avoid shopping when connected to a public WiFi. Use only your personal device and a secure
                network to make credit card transactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Keep your PIN and password safe</h2>
            <p>This one is a no-brainer. Always keep your PIN and password secure. If you have written it down somewhere
                or saved it somewhere, make sure that no one else knows about it. Do not save your PIN on any of the
                websites and avoid saving it on your computer.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Going cash-free</h2>
            <p>If demonetisation and the Covid- 19 pandemic are any indications, going cash-free is more in demand than
                ever before. Thankfully, digital banking solves this problem. Several digital banking features like
                UPIs, mobile wallets, and internet banking solutions allow users to make payments cash-free. This form
                of banking may also save a substantial amount of paper, making it better for the environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Opt for Tokenization of Cards </h2>
            <p>The payments industry has been abuzz with the term tokenization, which is set to add an extra layer of
                protection to your sensitive data, thereby preventing online frauds and data breaches. Card tokenization
                is a unique process in which your card details are converted into a unique token specific to your card.
                When you opt for tokenization, you have to enter your card details and opt for tokenization at the time
                of check-out after online shopping.
                <br>
                The merchant will forward the token to the respective bank or card network. The token is generated and
                sent back to the merchant. The next time you make an online payment, you will only see the last 4 digits
                of the card number on the merchant website/app. Just select the card basis the last 4 digits, enter the
                CVV and proceed with the payment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Immediately inform your bank if you lose your credit card </h2>
            <p>If you ever lose your credit card, it is very important that you inform your bank immediately and get it
                blocked. This will avoid any unauthorized transactions on your credit card..</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Bottom line </h2>
            <p>While credit cards are a boon, it is equally important to be aware of the dos and don’ts when using a
                credit card. The tips mentioned above are especially important for people who have just started using
                credit cards and might not be aware of the dangers associated with using a credit card.
