            <div style="width: 30%; padding: 20px;">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">With the ever increasing adoption of electronic payments, it has become
                    really important for businesses to have the necessary infrastructure to accept and process
                    electronic payments from their customers. The sheer convenience of making payments electronically
                    has made it so that many customers prefer making electronic payments and businesses that don’t
                    provide these services, risk losing business.

                    This is where Merchant services come into the picture.

        <div>
            <h2>1. What are Merchant services?</h2>
            <p>‘Merchant services’ is an umbrella term used to describe the services provided by banks that let
                businesses accept and process electronic payments. Earlier in simpler times, Merchant services meant
                credit card processing services. But today there are a number of services that fall under this umbrella
                term.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>2. What is a Merchant account? </h2>
            <p>When opting for Merchant services, the first thing that you will need is a Merchant account. It is a
                business bank account where you end up receiving the amount for all of your processed electronic
                transactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>3. Credit/Debit card processing </h2>
            <p>If you have ever been shopping, you must have seen those card terminals where you swipe your card and the
                money gets deducted from your bank account. This service is provided to businesses by banks. It includes
                the credit card terminal also called the POS machine and a merchant account.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>4. Payment Gateways</h2>
            <p>These are services used primarily by ecommerce websites or online businesses that need a way to accept
                payments through their online store. Payment Gateway services have become increasingly popular today
                with the ever increasing adoption of online shopping. If you are somebody who is looking to build their
                own online or app store, you will definitely need payment gateway services to start accepting payments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>5. QR codes and mobile payments </h2>
            <p>Another merchant service is the QR codes that you see at most shops today. In this service, a bank helps
                you set up a unique QR code for your business that is linked to your merchant account. Customers can
                simply scan the QR code and make payments to your business using their mobile phone.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2> How to avail Merchant services? </h2>
