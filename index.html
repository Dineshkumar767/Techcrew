        <p>Banking is the business of protecting money for others. Banks lend this money, generating interest that
            creates profits for the bank and its customers.

            A bank is a financial institution licensed to accept deposits and make loans. But they may also perform
            other financial services.

            The term “bank” can refer to many different types of financial institutions — including bank and trust
            companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions or any other type of institution that accepts
            deposits.

            Banks protect your cash from theft and natural disasters like fires or floods. Your insurance may not
            cover money lost in your home, car or on your person. But banks don’t typically carry the same risk.
            <br><br><br><br>
            Banks allow you to access your money when you need it. They can also provide “one-stop shopping” for
            financial needs from investments to home and auto loans, along with other financial services. Convenience,
            along with interest rates and low fees, are major selling points for banks.
            <br><br><br>
            There are several types of banks, typically grouped into a category based on the type of business they
            perform. Banks in a certain category offer similar services.

            Some banks may focus on consumers while others focus on investments, corporations or other sectors of
            financial services. Whether you are looking to manage your personal finances or grow your business, here is
            a list of common types of banks unique to every need.
