                When and When Not to Use Credit Card for Bill Payment

            </h1>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">Frank McNamara, a New York-based businessman, was enjoying dinner with his
                    wife at a restaurant when he noticed that he had forgotten his wallet. Thankfully, McNamara’s wife
                    paid the bill for his rescue. But given the embarrassment he faced, McNamara thought of developing a
                    financial product that would allow people to “use now, pay later.” And that was the necessity that
                    birthed the invention of the credit card.<br>
                    This was back in the 1950s. Over the decades, credit cards have become more advanced with premium
                    features, exciting discounts and rewards, and smoother transactions. However, this boon of a product
                    can turn into a debt trap if not swiped wisely.
                    <br>
                    Though life is unpredictable and you may need to rely on your credit card in a pinch, there are many
                    factors that are within your control. Below, Select speaks with Leslie H. Tayne, a debt-relief
                    attorney and founder of Tayne Law Group, to learn what are the most common credit card mistakes and
                    why you should avoid using your credit card in these 8 situations.

        <div class="content">
            <h2> When you haven’t paid off the balance </h2>
            <p>With credit card debt at an all time high, it’s wise to think twice before swiping your card. “If you can
                pay your balance in full each month, or you’ve budgeted to pay it off over time, using a credit card for
                purchases can be a great way to earn rewards on your purchases and build credit,” Tayne tells Select.
                <br>But if you maintain a revolving balance on your accounts, the sky-high interest rates will always
                negate your rewards and propel you into “a cycle of debt that can be difficult, lengthy and expensive to
                get out of,” she says.

                <br>If you’re worried that closing your account might ding your credit score, simply “leaving the card
                at home can be a great strategy,” says Tayne. Some issuers will close accounts due to inactivity, so
                it’s not a bad idea to put a small recurring purchase on your credit card (like your Netflix
                subscription) and set it to autopay each month so you don’t forget to pay it.
            </p>
            <h2> When you don’t know your available credit</h2>
            <p>“Don’t swipe if you aren’t sure what your account balance is,” says Tayne. “While most lenders have
                removed over-the-limit fees from their cards, that doesn’t mean you should spend up to or over your
                spending limit. Utilizing 100% of your available credit can lower your credit score and make you look
                like a riskier borrower.”
                <br>Experts recommend that you spend, at maximum, no more than 30% of your available credit. That’s one
                of the most important factors in achieving a good credit score.
            </p>

            <h2> When you’re just doing it for the rewards (but you haven’t done the math)</h2>
            <p>When deciding between using credit, debit or cash, it seems obvious to choose credit cards for the cash
                back and rewards. Some people even choose to pay their mortgage or rent with a credit card — but you
                must be careful.
                <br>Before paying any bill — whether your utilities, rent, mortgage or medical bills — always make sure
                that there are no fees for using a credit card. More often than not, there is a 2-3% processing fee that
                can negate any rewards you might earn. In this case, it’s best to use an alternative form of payment,
                like a check or a debit card.
            </p>
            <h2> When you’re afraid you have no other choice</h2>
            <p>When you’re about to make an exceptionally large purchase at a retail store or in the doctor’s office,
                you might be presented with the option to apply for a store credit card or a medical credit card. If
                you’re feeling strapped for cash, especially if the expense arose due to a medical emergency or an
                unexpected broken appliance, these cards may seem like your only option. And in many cases, they seem
                even more alluring because they come with a 0% promotional financing period.
                <br>But think twice. Fear makes consumers act impulsively, and adding pressure to the situation only
                makes things worse. Before signing up for a new credit card, thus adding a new inquiry to your credit
                history, you should stop and think whether it actually makes sense to use a store or medical credit
                card.
                <br>Read the fine print and ask whether the promotional financing comes with deferred interest. And if
                you’re in a medical office, ask about other payment plans.
                <br>You should also ask whether the cards carry an annual fee.
                <br>“The Best Buy store card, for example, can be a good deal if you know you have decent credit and can
                pay off the balance before the promotional period ends,” Tayne explains. “But if you apply for the card
                and have poor credit, you could be stuck with an annual fee of $59 just for having the card open.”
                <br>In the ideal world, you’ll have a little time to do some planning and open a 0% APR credit card to
                finance your large expense over a period of several months. That way, once you’ve paid off your balance,
                you can use the credit card for everyday purchases, unlike a medical or store card, which usually have
                limitations on where you can swipe them.
                <br>The BankAmericard® credit card offers no interest for the first 21 billing cycles on purchases and
                balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account (after, 15.49% to 25.49% variable APR),
                and there is no annual fee.
            </p>

                and there is no annual fee.</h2>
            <p>Just as you shouldn’t go grocery shopping when you’re hungry, you should stay away from the plastic if
                you are experiencing any range of strong emotions.
                <br>“It’s never a good idea to use your credit card when experiencing strong emotions, especially if you
                tend to steer toward ‘retail therapy,’” says Tayne.
                <br>“While you could argue that shopping makes you feel better when you’re upset, receiving your credit
                card statement in the mail will likely cause similar negative feelings that caused you to go shopping in
                the first place.
                <br>“During a period of heightened emotions, instead of reaching for your wallet, take a step back,”
                Tayne says. “Take a deep breath and recognize your spending triggers. Go for a walk or call a friend
                instead of going shopping.”
            </p>
            <h2>“During a period of heightened emotions, instead of reaching for your wallet, take a step back,” Tayne
                says. “Take a deep breath and recognize your spending triggers. Go for a walk or call a friend instead
                of going shopping.”</h2>
            <p>It’s a good idea to never give your credit card away to sources you don’t trust, including over phone or
                email, particularly in public areas using unsecured Wi-Fi. Using a virtual private network, or a VPN, is
                a way to protect yourself if you work remotely or travel a lot for business.
                <br>
                You should also be wary of writing your credit card information on paper forms, such as donation
                envelopes or subscription forms, when there is an alternative option. And on the internet, don’t click
                on advertisements without verifying the source; better yet try finding the original website rather than
                trust an ad to lead you there.
                <br>Fraudsters are always on the lookout for new ways to scrape personal information from financial
                transactions. If you use your credit card in some way that is outside of your routine, be sure to look
                at your statement within 24 hours or so to make sure there are no mysterious transactions.
                <br>
                But despite these threats, having a credit card with $0 fraud liability protection is actually one
                instance in which a credit card is much safer than a debit card, so long as you check your accounts
                regularly and remain vigilant about suspicious activity.
                <br>Chase is known for its excellent fraud protection for travel cards like the Chase Sapphire
                Preferred® Card and cash-back cards like the Chase Freedom®. Like many card issuers, Chase guarantees no
                liability for fraudulent activity, conducts 24/7 fraud monitoring on your account and gives you the
                ability to temporarily lock and unlock your account if you misplace your card. You can also activate
                account alerts for any transaction that’s made, and credit score monitoring is complimentary so you can
                stay on top of any activity that’s reported to the credit bureaus.
            </p>
            <h2> When you’re applying for a mortgage</h2>
            <p>If you’re applying for a mortgage or other loan products, it’s best to be conservative with your credit
                card. “The debt shown on your credit report will increase, thereby reducing your score and available
                credit while increasing your debt and liabilities,” Tayne explains.</p>

                card. “The debt shown on your credit report will increase, thereby reducing your score and available
                credit while increasing your debt and liabilities,” Tayne explains.</h2>
            <p>Most credit cards allow for a cash advance, meaning you can take out cash against your total credit limit
                when you need it. But it’s not advisable, says Tayne.
                <br>“The interest rate on cash advances is typically higher than the purchase APR, not to mention the
                cash advance fees on top of the higher interest rate,” Tayne tells Select. “For the same reason, it’s
                also not advisable to use your credit card for large purchases outside of a promotional offer, because
                interest fees can end up costing you more than the original amount charged after the balance is paid
                off.”
            </p>
            <h2>Bottom line</h2>
            <p>If you’ve used your credit card in one of these eight scenarios, you aren’t alone. Most consumers have,
                at one time or another, made a common credit card mistake or error when redeeming their rewards.
                <br>If these apply to you, it’s important to keep the bigger picture in perspective. Rather than fixate
                on what you’ve done wrong in the past, simply focus on making different choices in the future. And if
                you have an existing credit card balance you need to pay off, using a 0% interest credit card to do a
                balance transfer is one of the most common ways to get out of debt. Options like the Discover it®
                Balance Transfer, with an introductory 0% APR for the first 18 months on balance transfers (after,
                16.74% - 27.74% variable APR; there is a 3% intro balance transfer fee, then up to 5% on future balance
                transfers, see terms), could save you significantly and put you back in control.
